                <p>
                    I was born in 1986 in Taunton, Somerset where I was raised, I now live in Wellington with a family of my own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wanting to help people is something that has always been a desire of mine; which I very much enjoy, I started my 
                    working life as a nursery nurse and then looking after the elderly and vulnerable enabling them to stay in their 
                    own homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I joined the Bristol College of Massage & Bodywork as a student and studied an Holistic massage course where I 
                    qualified as a level 4 holistic massage therapist and attained a first aid certificate. This qualification also 
                    means that I am MTI registered (Massage Training Institute).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then I have attended two training courses-
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mobilising Massage (movement of joints)</li>
                        <li>Pregnancy Massage</li>
                    </ul>
                    I am keen to attend more massage courses to further my knowledge and offer other therapies in the future, watch this space!

            <h2>MY QUALIFICATIONS</h2>
            <br />
            <h3>what they mean to you</h4>
            <p>
                Level 4 holistic massage therapist enables me to practice Holistic massage as a professional. Looks at your 
                body as a whole and with a consultation, having a chat about you and how you live your life, we set out at 
                tailoring a massage that benefits "YOU".
            </p>
            <p>
                Mobilising massage means that I can move joints with care and easy for my clients and also to prevent 
                me from injuring myself by showing me the correct way to posturally position my self.
            </p>
            <h3>Why would you want this as part of a massage?</h3>
            <p>
                Well;
            </p>
            <p>
                - It Helps build up the cartilage in joint particularly helping those who have joint complains.
                <br />
                - It also helps to free your joints that have been held in place by daily tension/stress etc coaxing them back into their natural position.
                <br />
                - Mobilisation also is another way of freeing up tendons that attach muscle to bone.
            </p>
